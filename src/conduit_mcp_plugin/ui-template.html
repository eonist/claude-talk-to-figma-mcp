  UI panel markup for Conduit MCP Figma plugin.

  This HTML file defines the structure and style of the plugin's user interface,
  including connection controls (port input, connect/disconnect buttons),
  tabs for navigation, and a progress display section.

  The UI logic and communication with the plugin backend are handled by the
  corresponding 'ui.ts' script.
