# Understanding the claude-talk-to-figma-mcp Plugin Structure

Before diving into the specific structure of the claude-talk-to-figma-mcp plugin, it's important to understand that this project is an adaptation of Sonny Lazuardi's cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp, modified to work with Claude Desktop instead of Cursor. The plugin enables seamless communication between Anthropic's Claude AI and Figma using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overall Architecture

The plugin follows a bidirectional communication architecture that can be visualized as:

```
+----------------+ +-------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
| VS Code Cline |<--->| MCP |<--->| WebSocket Srv |<--->| Figma Plugin |
| (AI Agent)    |     |     |     | (Port 3055)   |     | (UI Plugin)  |
+----------------+ +-------+ +---------------+ +---------------+
```

This architecture facilitates real-time communication between Claude AI and Figma through a WebSocket server[1].

## Repository Structure

Based on the available information, the repository has the following main directories:

### Plugin Files (`src/claude_mcp_plugin/`)

This directory contains the Figma plugin components, including:

- **manifest.json**: Defines the plugin's metadata, permissions, and entry points[1]
- **UI components**: While specific files are not detailed in the search results, typical Figma plugins include:
  - An HTML file for the plugin UI
  - CSS for styling
  - JavaScript for UI logic and Figma API interactions

### MCP Server (`src/talk_to_figma_mcp/`)

The MCP server implementation includes:

- **server.ts**: Main entry point that handles communication between Claude and the WebSocket server[1]
- **Tools modules**: Organized by functionality (document-tools.ts, creation-tools.ts, etc.)

### WebSocket Server (`src/socket.ts`)

A WebSocket server running on port 3055 that facilitates communication between the MCP server and the Figma plugin[1][7].

## Plugin Installation

To install the plugin in Figma:

1. Go to **Menu > Plugins > Development > New Plugin**
2. Select "Import plugin from manifest"
3. Navigate to and select `src/claude_mcp_plugin/manifest.json`[1]

## Plugin Functionality

The plugin supports numerous commands organized into categories:

1. **Read commands**: Retrieve document information, selection, node details, etc.
2. **Write commands**: Create, modify, or delete Figma elements
3. **Image commands**: Insert local and remote images
4. **Text & Font commands**: Manipulate text elements and typography
5. **Effect commands**: Apply visual effects to nodes
6. **Misc commands**: Group/ungroup nodes, export, join channel, etc.[1]

## Recent Updates

The plugin has seen regular updates, with recent versions (0.4.9 as of May 8, 2025) adding features like:

- Robust WebSocket reconnection logic
- Batch local-image insertion support
- Rectangle-to-frame conversion
- Separation of UI and protocol logic[1]

Previous updates (0.4.8, May 7, 2025) added gradient support, remote image insertion, and local image support[1].

## Communication Flow

1. A user prompts Claude with a command to interact with Figma
2. Claude passes the command to the MCP server
3. The MCP server sends the command to the WebSocket server
4. The WebSocket server forwards the command to the Figma plugin
5. The Figma plugin executes the command using the Figma API
6. Results flow back through the same channels to Claude[1][7]

This plugin represents a sophisticated integration between AI and design tools, allowing for powerful design automation and AI-assisted workflows through natural language commands.

To explore the detailed structure of specific files, you would need to examine the repository code directly, as the search results don't provide file-level details of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation.
